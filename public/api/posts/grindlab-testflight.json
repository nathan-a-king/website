It will be a free app on the iOS App Store.\n\nGrindLab began as a side experiment — a way to quantify what baristas feel by intuition: grind consistency. What started as a Python script for analyzing particle distributions slowly evolved into a full-fledged iOS app. It’s been rewritten multiple times, redesigned in SwiftUI, and rebuilt around an image-processing engine that fuses **Vision**, **Accelerate**, and **Core Image** frameworks for precision analysis.\n\nEach milestone along the way — from detecting the first usable grind histogram to achieving smooth real-time analysis on-device — has pushed GrindLab closer to what I imagined: a creative tool that helps people understand their coffee as deeply as they taste it.\n\n## What’s Included in the Initial Public Release\n\nGrindLab’s first release is built around the core features that make grind analysis both powerful and approachable:\n\n- **Graphical grind distribution measurements** using advanced particle detection and clustering algorithms\n- **Integrated brew timer** with the ability to create and save recipes\n- **Saved analysis history**, allowing comparisons across sessions and grinders\n- **Tasting notes** for each saved grind analysis — because data only matters if it connects to flavor\n\nTogether, these create a workflow that begins with curiosity and ends with reflection: capture, analyze, brew, taste, and learn.\n\n## Planned Features for Future Updates\n\nThe foundation is in place — and now the fun begins.\nFuture releases will explore how AI and calibration can help baristas interpret their own data intuitively:\n\n- **Smart recommendations** based on grind analysis patterns and tasting notes\n- **Improved calibration** for greater flexibility in photo capture and lighting conditions\n\nThese are deep technical challenges, but also creative ones — translating numbers into insights that feel human.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThe private TestFlight will run for several months while I refine the workflow, smooth out UI quirks, and gather feedback from early testers in the coffee community.\nIf you’re interested in helping shape GrindLab, reach out — your feedback will directly influence the first public release.\n\nA beta isn’t just about finding bugs; it’s about refining intuition. Every dataset, every brew, every small inconsistency teaches the app (and me) something new.\n\nThe goal has always been more than an app. GrindLab is part of a broader philosophy: bridging the art and science of coffee. Thank you to everyone who’s followed the project so far. The next few months will be about testing, listening, and polishing — bringing GrindLab from prototype to polished companion for coffee enthusiasts everywhere.\n\n---\n\n**Coming January 2026 — free on the Apple iOS App Store.**\n"
