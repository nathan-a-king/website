The next trillion-dollar tech company won't be built by creating the best AI model—it will be built by controlling how, where, and why people use AI. Just as Microsoft didn't win the PC era by making the best chips, today's AI leaders are racing not just to build better models, but to become the indispensable platform through which AI is accessed and deployed. Last quarter, over 50% of all venture capital funding went to AI-focused companies, totaling more than $60 billion of investment. The extreme rate with which VC firms are pouring money into Artificial Intelligence begs an important question: what is the path to profitability for companies like OpenAI?

AI startups have a relatively straightforward revenue model – subscription-based pricing for access to cutting-edge models and usage-based pricing for access to the API. Extremely high R&D and capital costs make attracting more paid users a requirement, but doing this also increases their marginal costs of inference. Therefore, paid users must offset their own marginal costs while subsidizing the costs of free users before beginning to chip away at those massive fixed costs that investors are currently covering. How can these aggressive revenue numbers be achieved without the assistance of external capital?

OpenAI and the other labs creating foundation models have no competitive moat and few products that fit wide swaths of the market. They have APIs that allow developers to create products, but that further commoditizes their main strength.

## The Moat of the Personal Computer Revolution

Let’s look at the first transformational change in technology to see how our current future might play out. Much like our foundation models today, the integrated circuit and transistor were commodities. The moat that helped lock in decades of Windows/Intel hegemony was Microsoft’s platform deals.

It wasn’t the hardware itself that dictated dominance, but the strategic positioning of software as a control point—Windows became the layer through which users interacted with computing, and Intel became the default engine beneath. The real power lay not in the invention, but in the ecosystem built around it: developer tools, third-party software, enterprise integrations, and, most critically, distribution deals that ensured Windows shipped on nearly every PC.

Foundation models may be the new transistors—powerful, essential, but increasingly commoditized. The question becomes: who builds the new “Windows” for AI? Will it be a developer platform, a ubiquitous interface layer, or a vertically integrated product experience? The companies that succeed in building sticky platforms around foundation models—whether through proprietary data, user workflows, or ecosystem lock-in—may become the long-term leaders in artificial intelligence.

It’s interesting to note the trend of OpenAI enhancing its API with features typically reserved for subscribers at a faster pace. They’re also adding features to their API that will make it more difficult for developers to switch model providers. Look no further than how their new responses API compares to the original chat completions API. The new API is stateful, which makes it both easier to build solutions with and far more difficult to switch out with the API of another provider.

But there’s another layer to this. We’re seeing the early signs of this platform consolidation. Just as Microsoft leveraged pre-installation deals and developer incentives to make Windows indispensable, today’s AI leaders are racing to become the default platform on which others build. Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, Anthropic’s partnership with Amazon, and Google’s embedding of Gemini into its product suite all mirror those earlier moves—where distribution, not just innovation, becomes the true competitive edge. The players who control not just the models, but the channels of user interaction—browsers, operating systems, productivity tools, search, or even chip infrastructure—are best positioned to own the AI era.

We’re entering a phase where control over context becomes as important as control over compute. Just as Windows became the context for productivity and the web browser the context for search, whoever owns the AI context—how, where, and why users invoke intelligence—will shape the future. That’s the real platform play.

    excerpt: "Apple is failing to implement artificial intelligence in a way that plays to their greatest strengths.",
    content: `
Apple has two major advantages in the AI race. Their ARM-based SoC’s unified memory architecture allows the GPU and Neural Engine access to far more RAM than competitors. This architectural advantage allows excellent performance of smaller models running on device as the context window grows. Each token requires a key/value pair, which causes the memory footprint to quickly grow as individual conversations get longer. Apple is not taking advantage of their most valuable resource, the platform advantage – access to *all* of my personal data.  

[Mark Gurman at Bloomberg reports:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-s-long-promised-ai-overhaul-for-siri-runs-into-bugs-possible-delays?srnd=phx-technology)

> “The goal is to ultimately offer a more versatile Siri that can seamlessly tap into customers’ information and communication. For instance, users will be able to ask for a file or song that they discussed with a friend over text. Siri would then automatically retrieve that item. Apple also has demonstrated the ability for Siri to quickly locate someone’s driver’s license number by reviewing their photos.”

This is Apple’s competitive differentiator and where Apple should have focused its resources from the start. Why can't I ask questions about my archived email or find correlations in exercise volume and sleep quality within the Health app?  

Apple’s real AI advantage isn’t just hardware — it’s the platform. A company that prides itself on tight integration across devices should be leading in AI that understands *me*. The ability to surface insights from my personal data, securely and privately, is where Apple could create the most compelling user experience.

    title: "Beyond the Chatbot",
    date: "July 12, 2025",
    excerpt: "AI-first products demand a different approach. It's not just about embedding a model...",
    content: `
When ChatGPT first arrived, the chat interface felt fresh—almost magical. For the first time, anyone could type a question, a prompt, or even a vague musing into a box and get back something surprisingly coherent, sometimes even profound. It was playful, frictionless, and conversational.

That novelty gave generative AI its mainstream moment. The chat paradigm was simple enough to onboard millions and powerful enough to hint at something revolutionary. But novelty doesn’t scale, and magic doesn’t sustain workflows. We're now stuck in a chatbot trap. Every major tech company has now bolted an AI chatbot onto their products—Microsoft has Copilot, Google has Bard, Slack has Claude, and seemingly every startup has their own variation. Each promises revolutionary capabilities, but they all share the same fundamental flaw: they force users to stop what they're doing, open a chat window, and attempt to translate their needs into a prompt.

The real opportunity now lies in embedding AI into **sophisticated, task-oriented interfaces**—not as a gimmick, but as a deeply integrated assistant that respects the user’s intent, context, and expertise. Especially for power users, the current paradigm is failing, and failing spectacularly.

The chat interface is a productivity bottleneck—a useful metaphor for conversation—but a terrible interface for complex work. The next wave of AI-native products shouldn’t aim to replace existing workflows with generic chatbots. They should embed AI inside the workflow, augmenting tools like notebooks, CRMs, design software, IDEs, and dashboards.

## The Power of Context

The tight integration of AI into the user’s workspace not only allows users to leverage AI without context switching, but it provides the model with the crucial context awareness needed to become a creative partner to the user. Instead of operating in a vacuum, the AI can draw on the surrounding information—the document being written, the code being edited, the data being analyzed, or the customer record being reviewed—to offer more relevant, precise, and timely contributions.

This transforms the interaction from a disconnected Q&A into a dynamic collaboration, where the AI isn’t just responding to isolated prompts but actively supporting the user's broader goals. The result is a smoother, more intelligent workflow—one that feels less like issuing commands and more like working alongside a trusted assistant who understands the bigger picture.

## Nonlinear Interaction

Nonlinear interaction means breaking free from the rigid, turn-based structure of chat. In most current interfaces, each interaction is treated as a one-way exchange: you ask a question, the AI responds, and the thread continues forward. But real work is rarely linear. Creative and analytical tasks require detours, iterations, backtracking, and branching exploration.

Users don’t just want to react to AI output—they want to revisit earlier steps, tweak specific parts of a prompt or dataset, fork different approaches, and compare outcomes side by side. The interaction model needs the ability to maintain multiple concurrent threads of exploration, to branch and merge ideas, to version and rollback changes. They want a workspace where ideas can evolve in parallel, not a conveyor belt of prompts disappearing into a scrolling void.

## The Path Forward

Ultimately, AI should enhance existing workflows—not replace them with inferior interaction patterns. The best AI tools won’t ask users to leave their environment or reframe their problem in prompt-speak. They’ll **meet users where they are**, elevate their work, and disappear into the background when not needed.

he next generation of AI tools will be judged not by how well they chat, but by how seamlessly they integrate into our existing workflows. We need tools that:

- Preserve context and maintain state across sessions
- Support branching and versioning of AI-assisted work
- Provide granular control over AI involvement
- Integrate naturally with existing software ecosystems
- Respect user privacy and data sovereignty

The chatbot era served its purpose—it showed us what was possible. Now it's time to build something better.
