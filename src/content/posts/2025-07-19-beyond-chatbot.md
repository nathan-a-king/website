When ChatGPT first launched, the chat interface felt **novel** and even *magical*. You could type a question and receive a thoughtful answer in plain English. It was like talking to a super-intelligent friend who never slept.

But over time, we've started to feel the limits of this format. Power users don't just want to chat. They want to **build**, **explore**, and **execute**. Copying answers from chat into other tools is tedious. 

> The future isn't just smarter AI—it's better interfaces for working alongside it.

## The Problem with Chat

AI should enhance your workflow, not interrupt it. The next generation of AI tools won't just answer questions—they'll help you:

- Write and edit documents
- Code and debug programs  
- Organize and structure information
- Design and prototype ideas
- Solve problems within context

That's the leap we need to make: **from chatbot to creative partner**.
