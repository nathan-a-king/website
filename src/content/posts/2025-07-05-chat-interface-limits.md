Chat interfaces are flexible, but they're not always the right fit. Sometimes, you need **structure**. 

## Beyond the Text Box

Think about how we actually organize thought:

- **Tables** for comparing options
- **Forms** for structured input
- **Timelines** for sequential planning  
- **Canvases** for spatial thinking
- **Diagrams** for relationships

When we constrain AI to a text box, we limit its potential. 

> The challenge now is to design interfaces that surface the full power of the modelâ€”without drowning the user in complexity.

### The Path Forward

The next wave of AI interfaces will be:

1. **Multi-modal** - Supporting text, images, voice, and gestures
2. **Contextual** - Adapting to the task at hand
3. **Collaborative** - Enabling real-time co-creation
4. **Invisible** - Feeling natural and intuitive

*The best interface is the one you don't notice.*
