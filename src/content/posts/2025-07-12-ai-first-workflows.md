AI-first products demand a different approach. It's not just about embedding a modelâ€”it's about **rethinking the entire user experience**.

## Key Principles

We need tools that are:

1. **Context-aware** - Understanding where you are and what you're working on
2. **Continuously learning** - Adapting to your patterns and preferences  
3. **Deeply integrated** - Seamlessly woven into existing workflows

> The magic happens when AI isn't a feature, but a co-pilot.

The best AI tools don't feel like tools. They feel like *extensions of your own thinking*.

### The Future is Collaborative

Instead of asking AI to do things **for** you, the future is about AI working **with** you in real-time, augmenting your capabilities without disrupting your flow.
